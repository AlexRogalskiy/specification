# The OpenMessaging Specification repository

This repository is a place to document (and discuss) the OpenMessaging specification itself (independent of any particular language or platform).

# Goals
OpenMessaging is vendor-neutral and language-independent, provides industry guidelines for areas of finance, e-commerce, IoT and big-data, and aimed to develop messaging and streaming applications across heterogeneous systems and platforms.
